In this question, we'll explore the connection between signals and combinations of waves.

    "## (Optional) Q1d: Pushing the Envelope\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all the music we've made has sounded robotic. In this part, we'll fix that and make our notes sound like they're coming from an actual instrument! \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that our model of notes as pure tones is too idealistic — instruments don't produce exact sinusoids at a single frequency with constant amplitude. There are two main differences between our pure tones and how instruments actually work (or at least what most models of them assume):\n",
    "1. **Overtones**. When you play Middle C, you don't just get Middle C. You also get several higher frequencies added in that give instruments a \"richer\" sound than what we've heard so far in this question. These are known as *overtones*. Most instruments are finely tuned so that the only overtones included are the harmonics (integer multiples of the frequency of the note played). So, rather than generating the \"A\" directly below Middle C as a 220 Hz sound, we should also be including the next several harmonics at 440 Hz, 880 Hz, and so on, with the amplitudes dying out as the frequency increases (otherwise, the high-pitched sounds would be unpleasant).\n",
    "2. **Attack and Release Time**. All our notes have been designed to instantly switch between off and on so far: we instantly play the sinusoid at full power as soon as it starts, and then immediately stop it at the end. In actual instruments, there's some delay between the note starting and reaching full volume, known as *attack time*, and then again after it hits a sustained level before the sound completely fades away, called *release time*. The actual times themselves depend on the physical characteristics of the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have an idea how we could handle (1) — just make a \"chord\" from harmonics of a note every time we want to play it by using our `chord_gen` function, feeding in an array of amplitudes that drops off toward zero for the higher harmonics. The number of harmonics to include, and the rate at which to have the amplitudes drop off depend on the specific instrument being simulated. Generally, more harmonics produces a more \"full\" and organ-like sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking care of (2) is a bit more complicated, however. One of the key developments in electronic music was the invention of the **ADSR Envelope**, which accounts for the non-instant rise and fall times of real instruments. The acronym stands for Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release, and is shown below (image source: Wikipedia).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/ADSR.png\" style=\"width:30em\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing an ADSR envelope, call it $w(n)$, we modulate our music signal $x(n)$ with it to produce the signal $y(n) = w(n)x(n)$, which attenuates the sinusoid as appropriate. Again, picking the specific parameters depends on the instrument you want to mimic. To get a feel for what this looks like, run the cell below."

If you're unsure about whether or not a function is allowed, just ask on Piazza.\n",
